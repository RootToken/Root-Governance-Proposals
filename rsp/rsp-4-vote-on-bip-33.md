## Proposer

Root DAO Multisig

## RSP Process Note

Per the process outlined in the [RDM Process](https://docs.roottoken.org/governance/root-token/rdm-process#rsp-proposal-and-voting), the Root DAO Multisig (RDM) will repost BIPs on the Root Stalk Proposals Snapshot page as RSPs.

## Quorum

An account's vote for a given RSP, or Voting Roots, is counted as the minimum of its Roots between the beginning and end of the Voting Period.

Quorum is more than half of the total Voting Roots voting For, or about **81,910** Roots voting For based on the time of proposal.

## Voting Period

The Voting Period for RSP-4 ends 12 hours before the end of the Voting Period for BIP-33 in order to allow RDM Signers sufficient time to execute the vote.

## Proposal

We propose that the RDM executes the will of the Root DAO by voting on BIP-33 in accordance with the outcome of RSP-4. If RSP-4 does not pass, the RDM will not participate in the vote.
